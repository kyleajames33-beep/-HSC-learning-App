    "correctAnswer": "It decreases biodiversity by creating a monoculture",
    "explanation": "Relying on a single, genetically uniform crop variety (a monoculture) reduces genetic diversity, making the entire food supply more vulnerable to a single new disease or pest.",

    "correctAnswer": "The loss of genetic diversity within a species, particularly traditional crop varieties",
