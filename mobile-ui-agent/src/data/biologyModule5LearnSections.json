This variation allows populations to adapt to environmental changes through natural selection and provides disease resistance, but requires energy and time to find mates, resulting in slower reproduction rates.\n\nIn contrast, asexual reproduction uses one parent to produce genetically identical offspring without gamete fusion. This enables rapid reproduction without finding mates and uses less energy, but lacks genetic variation, making populations vulnerable to disease and environmental change since all individuals are clones.\n\nFor example, bacteria reproduce asexually via binary fission for rapid population growth in stable environments, while humans use sexual reproduction to maintain genetic diversity that allows adaptation to diseases and changing conditions."

Mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid daughter cells (2n → 2n) through one division cycle, enabling growth and repair in somatic cells. For example, skin cells undergo mitosis to heal wounds while maintaining the chromosome number of 46 in humans.\n\nIn contrast, meiosis produces four genetically unique haploid gametes (2n → n) through two divisions, essential for sexual reproduction. During meiosis I, crossing over and independent assortment generate genetic variation, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids. This halves the chromosome number to 23 in human gametes, ensuring restoration to 46 during fertilization.\n\nThe key distinction is that mitosis maintains genetic stability for body maintenance, while meiosis creates genetic diversity necessary for evolution and adaptation in sexually reproducing organisms."

Independent Assortment:**\nDuring metaphase I, chromosome pairs align randomly:\n• Each homologous pair orients independently\n• Maternal or paternal chromosome can go to either pole\n• For humans (23 pairs): 2²³ = 8.4 million possible combinations\n• **Result**: Each gamete gets a random mix of maternal/paternal chromosomes\n\n**3.

                        "content": "Sample Answer:\n\nEnvironmental factors critically control reproductive timing to maximize offspring survival. Photoperiod is a key regulator, with increasing day length in spring triggering hormone production in birds and mammals. For example, magpies use longer days as a signal to begin nesting because extended daylight provides more time to gather food for chicks.\n\nTemperature also plays a vital role, particularly in ectotherms. Many reptiles and amphibians require specific temperature thresholds to initiate breeding, while some species like sea turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination where incubation temperature determines offspring sex. Rainfall is critical for desert organisms, triggering rapid reproduction during brief wet periods when resources are abundant.\n\nResource availability fundamentally influences reproductive success. Australian kangaroos demonstrate embryonic diapause, pausing embryo development during drought and resuming pregnancy when rainfall returns and food becomes available. This adaptation ensures joeys are born when mothers can access sufficient nutrition for lactation.\n\nClimate change threatens these ancient timing mechanisms by disrupting reliable environmental cues, leading to phenological mismatches between reproduction and resource availability, potentially reducing population viability."

Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere after DNA replication. In humans, there are 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) - 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes.\n\nThe structure of chromosomes can be studied at different levels of organization. At the molecular level, DNA wraps around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which further coil and condense into chromatin fibers. During cell division, this chromatin condenses even further into the visible X-shaped chromosomes we recognize in karyotypes.\n\nChromosomes can be identified by their size, centromere position (metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric), and banding patterns when stained.

The process involves collecting cells (often from blood, amniotic fluid, or chorionic villi), culturing them to increase cell numbers, arresting division at metaphase using colchicine, and then staining and photographing the chromosomes.\n\nThe chromosomes are then arranged in homologous pairs by size and centromere position, numbered from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22), with sex chromosomes placed last. Advanced techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can provide even more detailed information about specific chromosomal regions.\n\nKaryotype analysis can reveal numerical abnormalities (aneuploidy) such as monosomy (one chromosome missing) or trisomy (one extra chromosome), as well as structural abnormalities like deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.",

The orientation of each pair is random and independent of the others. This means that the maternal and paternal chromosomes are distributed into the gametes in random combinations.\n\nStep 3: Link to Offspring Variation (2 marks)\nTogether, these processes ensure that each gamete produced is genetically unique.

By performing monohybrid crosses (crosses involving one trait), Mendel discovered that traits are inherited as discrete units, which we now call genes.\n\nMendel's First Law, the Law of Segregation, states that for each trait, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. These alleles separate (segregate) from each other during gamete formation (meiosis), so that a gamete will receive only one allele for each trait. When the gametes combine at fertilization, the offspring receives one allele from each parent, restoring the pair.

He inherits his Y chromosome from his father and his X chromosome from his mother (II-2). He inherited the X chromosome carrying the recessive allele (X^a) from his mother.

The first step is the unwinding of the double helix by an enzyme called DNA helicase, which breaks the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs.

An enzyme called DNA polymerase moves along each template strand and adds new nucleotides according to the complementary base pairing rules. On one strand (the leading strand), synthesis is continuous. On the other strand (the lagging strand), synthesis occurs in short fragments called Okazaki fragments, which are later joined together by the enzyme DNA ligase.

The process involves a series of heating and cooling cycles. First, the DNA is heated to separate the two strands (denaturation). Then, the temperature is lowered to allow short DNA primers to bind to the complementary sequences on the template strands (annealing). Finally, a heat-stable DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) extends the primers, synthesizing new DNA strands (extension). This cycle is repeated 20-40 times, leading to an exponential amplification of the target DNA sequence.",

This made the light-coloured moths more visible to predators (birds) against the dark bark.\n\nStep 3: Differential Survival and Reproduction (2 marks)\nThe dark-coloured moths were better camouflaged on the sooty trees and thus had a higher survival rate. They were more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on the allele for dark colour to their offspring.\n\nStep 4: Change in Allele Frequency (1 mark)\nOver time, the frequency of the dark colour allele increased in the population, and the dark-coloured phenotype became more common.

This prevents gene flow between them.\n\nStep 2: Different Selection Pressures (2 marks)\nThe two isolated populations may experience different environmental conditions, such as water temperature, food sources, or predators. These different conditions create different selection pressures.\n\nStep 3: Natural Selection and Genetic Drift (2 marks)\nIn each population, natural selection will favor individuals with traits best suited to their specific environment. Additionally, random genetic drift can cause changes in allele frequencies. Over many generations, these processes will lead to the accumulation of genetic differences between the two populations.\n\nStep 4: Reproductive Isolation (1 mark)\nEventually, the genetic differences may become so significant that the two populations are no longer able to interbreed and produce fertile offspring, even if the land bridge were to disappear. At this point, they are considered two distinct species.",

Allopatric speciation is the most common form, where a population is divided by a geographic barrier. The isolated populations then evolve independently through mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Over time, these changes can lead to reproductive isolation. Sympatric speciation is less common and occurs without geographic separation. It can be driven by factors such as polyploidy (in plants), habitat differentiation, and sexual selection.",
