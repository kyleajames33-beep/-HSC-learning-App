            "full_answer": "Patterns of non-infectious diseases in populations can be analysed by studying their incidence and prevalence (1 mark). Incidence is the number of new cases of a disease in a population over a specific period of time, while prevalence is the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a specific point in time (2 marks). By analysing these patterns, epidemiologists can identify risk factors for diseases and develop strategies for prevention and control (3 marks).",
