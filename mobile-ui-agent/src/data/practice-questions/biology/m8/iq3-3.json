The strengths of this type of study are that it can be used to establish a temporal relationship between exposure and outcome, and it can be used to calculate incidence (2 marks). However, cohort studies can be expensive and time-consuming to conduct, and they are not suitable for studying rare diseases (2 marks). For example, the Framingham Heart Study is a long-term cohort study that has provided valuable information about the risk factors for heart disease (2 marks).",
