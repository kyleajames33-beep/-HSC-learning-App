They are highly resistant to heat, desiccation, radiation, and chemical disinfectants, allowing the bacteria to survive for long periods of time in the environment (2 marks). When conditions become favourable again, the endospore can germinate and give rise to a vegetative cell, which can then cause infection. This ability to survive in a dormant state greatly facilitates the transmission of these bacteria, as they can persist in the environment and be transmitted to a new host long after they were released from the original host (2 marks).",

            "full_answer": "This statement is largely accurate. From an evolutionary perspective, the success of a pathogen is measured by its ability to reproduce and be transmitted to new hosts (2 marks). A pathogen that quickly kills its host may not have enough time to be transmitted to a new host, and therefore may not be as successful as a pathogen that causes a less severe, chronic infection. For example, the common cold virus causes a mild illness and is highly transmissible, making it a very successful pathogen (2 marks). However, there are exceptions. For some pathogens, causing severe disease may be part of their transmission strategy. For example, the cholera bacterium causes severe diarrhoea, which helps to spread the bacteria in the water supply (2 marks).",
