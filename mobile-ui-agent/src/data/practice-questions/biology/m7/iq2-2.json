These signals cause blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the area (causing redness and heat), and to become more permeable, allowing fluid and immune cells to move into the tissue (causing swelling) (2 marks).

The adaptive immune response is a slower, more specific response that involves the production of antibodies and T cells that are tailored to a specific pathogen. This response also creates immunological memory, which allows for a faster and more effective response to future infections by the same pathogen (2 marks). Therefore, the innate and adaptive immune systems work together to provide a comprehensive and effective defence against a wide range of pathogens (2 marks).",
