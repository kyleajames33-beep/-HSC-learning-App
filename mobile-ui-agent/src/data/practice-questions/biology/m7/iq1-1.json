In the human host, Plasmodium infects red blood cells and reproduces asexually, causing the cells to burst and release more parasites. Some of these parasites develop into gametocytes, which are the sexual stage of the parasite (2 marks). When a mosquito bites an infected human, it ingests the gametocytes. In the mosquito, the gametocytes mature and fuse to form zygotes, which then develop into sporozoites. These sporozoites migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands, ready to be injected into a new human host when the mosquito bites again (2 marks).",

This had a devastating impact on society, leading to economic collapse, social unrest, and a decline in the power of the church. In modern times, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a similar devastating impact, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where it has caused millions of deaths and orphaned millions of children (2 marks).
