By limiting the movement of people between countries, travel restrictions can delay the introduction of the disease into new areas, giving countries more time to prepare their healthcare systems (2 marks). However, travel restrictions are often difficult to enforce, can have significant economic and social costs, and may not be effective in the long term, especially for highly transmissible diseases (2 marks). For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions were implemented by many countries, but they were not able to completely stop the global spread of the virus. Therefore, while travel restrictions can be a useful tool, they are most effective when used as part of a comprehensive strategy that also includes other public health measures (2 marks).",
