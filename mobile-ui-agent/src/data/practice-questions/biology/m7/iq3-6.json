Culturally diverse strategies, such as the use of traditional herbal medicines, may have some effectiveness for certain diseases, but they often lack rigorous scientific evidence and are not a substitute for modern medicine (2 marks). Current strategies, such as vaccination and public health campaigns, are highly effective when implemented properly. Vaccination can provide long-term immunity and even eradicate diseases, while public health campaigns can empower individuals to make informed decisions to protect their health. Therefore, a combination of evidence-based modern strategies is the most effective approach to controlling the spread of infectious diseases (2 marks).",
