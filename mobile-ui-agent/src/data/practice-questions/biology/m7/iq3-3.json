For example, HIV/AIDS is treated with a combination of antiviral drugs known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (2 marks). This approach is effective because it targets different stages of the HIV life cycle, making it more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to all the drugs at once (2 marks). However, combination therapy can be expensive and may have significant side effects. Therefore, while it is a powerful tool, it is not always a perfect solution and the benefits must be weighed against the costs and risks (2 marks).",
