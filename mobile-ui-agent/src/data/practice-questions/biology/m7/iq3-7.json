Initially, the virus was highly virulent, killing over 99% of infected rabbits (1 mark). However, over time, the virus evolved to become less virulent, and the rabbits evolved to become more resistant to the virus (2 marks). This is because a less virulent virus that allowed its host to live longer had a greater chance of being transmitted to other rabbits. Similarly, rabbits with some resistance to the virus were more likely to survive and reproduce (2 marks).",
