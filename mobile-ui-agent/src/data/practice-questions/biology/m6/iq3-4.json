They can influence gene expression by altering the accessibility of the DNA to transcription factors (2 marks). For example, DNA methylation can repress gene expression by preventing transcription factors from binding to the DNA, while histone acetylation can promote gene expression by making the DNA more accessible (2 marks).",
