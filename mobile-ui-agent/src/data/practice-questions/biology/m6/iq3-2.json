            "full_answer": "DNA sequencing is a powerful tool for diagnosing genetic disorders. It allows for the precise identification of mutations in an individual's DNA, which can confirm a diagnosis and provide information about the prognosis of the disease (2 marks). However, DNA sequencing also has limitations. It can be expensive and time-consuming, and it may not be able to identify all types of mutations (2 marks). Furthermore, the results of DNA sequencing can have significant ethical and social implications, such as the potential for genetic discrimination (2 marks).",
