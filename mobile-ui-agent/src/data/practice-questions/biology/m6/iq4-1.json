            "full_answer": "A transgenic organism is created by inserting a gene from one organism into the genome of another organism (1 mark). This is done using recombinant DNA technology, which involves cutting the desired gene from the donor organism and pasting it into a vector, such as a plasmid (1 mark). The vector is then introduced into the host organism, where the gene is incorporated into the host's genome (1 mark). The host organism will then express the new gene and will be a transgenic organism (1 mark).",
