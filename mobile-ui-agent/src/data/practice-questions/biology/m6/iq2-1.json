            "full_answer": "Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces four genetically unique haploid gametes (1 mark). Recombination, or crossing over, occurs during prophase I of meiosis and involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, creating new combinations of alleles (2 marks). Independent assortment occurs during metaphase I of meiosis and is the random orientation of homologous chromosome pairs at the metaphase plate, leading to a variety of different combinations of chromosomes in the gametes (2 marks).",
