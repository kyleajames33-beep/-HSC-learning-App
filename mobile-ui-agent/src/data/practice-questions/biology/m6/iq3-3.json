            "full_answer": "Bioinformatics is the use of computational tools to analyse biological data. It can be used to study gene regulation in a number of ways (1 mark). For example, bioinformatics can be used to identify transcription factor binding sites in DNA, which can help to understand how genes are switched on and off (1 mark). It can also be used to analyse gene expression data from microarrays or RNA-seq experiments, which can reveal how gene expression patterns change in response to different stimuli (2 marks).",
