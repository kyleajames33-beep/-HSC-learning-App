This variation allows populations to adapt to environmental changes through natural selection and provides disease resistance, but requires energy and time to find mates, resulting in slower reproduction rates.\n\nIn contrast, asexual reproduction uses one parent to produce genetically identical offspring without gamete fusion. This enables rapid reproduction without finding mates and uses less energy, but lacks genetic variation, making populations vulnerable to disease and environmental change since all individuals are clones.\n\nFor example, bacteria reproduce asexually via binary fission for rapid population growth in stable environments, while humans use sexual reproduction to maintain genetic diversity that allows adaptation to diseases and changing conditions."

Mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid daughter cells (2n â†’ 2n) through one division cycle, enabling growth and repair in somatic cells. For example, skin cells undergo mitosis to heal wounds while maintaining the chromosome number of 46 in humans.\n\nIn contrast, meiosis produces four genetically unique haploid gametes (2n â†’ n) through two divisions, essential for sexual reproduction. During meiosis I, crossing over and independent assortment generate genetic variation, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids. This halves the chromosome number to 23 in human gametes, ensuring restoration to 46 during fertilization.\n\nThe key distinction is that mitosis maintains genetic stability for body maintenance, while meiosis creates genetic diversity necessary for evolution and adaptation in sexually reproducing organisms."

                        "content": "Sample Answer:\n\nEnvironmental factors critically control reproductive timing to maximize offspring survival. Photoperiod is a key regulator, with increasing day length in spring triggering hormone production in birds and mammals. For example, magpies use longer days as a signal to begin nesting because extended daylight provides more time to gather food for chicks.\n\nTemperature also plays a vital role, particularly in ectotherms. Many reptiles and amphibians require specific temperature thresholds to initiate breeding, while some species like sea turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination where incubation temperature determines offspring sex. Rainfall is critical for desert organisms, triggering rapid reproduction during brief wet periods when resources are abundant.\n\nResource availability fundamentally influences reproductive success. Australian kangaroos demonstrate embryonic diapause, pausing embryo development during drought and resuming pregnancy when rainfall returns and food becomes available. This adaptation ensures joeys are born when mothers can access sufficient nutrition for lactation.\n\nClimate change threatens these ancient timing mechanisms by disrupting reliable environmental cues, leading to phenological mismatches between reproduction and resource availability, potentially reducing population viability."
